# Challenge Spring Boot: SocialMeli

## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `DesafioSpringApplication.java` class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like so:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```

When you start the app charge data example to users automatically .

The data example to users is there in users.json and you can consult with this EndPoint.


```shell
METHOD: GET
SIGN: users/all
RESPONSE: [
  userId userName,
  .
  .
  .
]
```

Is required the file user.json and publications.json to start the app.
