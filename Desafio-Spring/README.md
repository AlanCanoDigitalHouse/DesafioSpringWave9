###Introduction & Technologies
This app will allow you to store and manipulate the relationship
(following) of the users. You'll also be able to create and filter
posts and prodcuts in various ways.
This is a Java Server Application made with Springboot using JDK11.

###Setup
The Application should be ready to run as soon as you launch it.

You will want to make sure that the whole project compiles,
and you may have to resolve some Maven dependances.

You'll also want to verify that the JSON files on src.main.resources.static were copied to target.classes.static when the application is first launched.

All JSON files on said folder should be empty brackets ```[]``` except for the users.json file which should have a list of 6 users.

###Usage
The whole scope of functionalities, endpoints, and input/output formats can be found in [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iPdb8VVgxi4SZtWNqwHo_lo-quODgi3i/view).
The Application will (for now) not be further developed, as it was simply a challenge to get some practice using SpringBoot Framework.
